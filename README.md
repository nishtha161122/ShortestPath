# ShortestPath
Dijkstra’s Algorithm in Java
Java implementation of Dijkstra’s Algorithm for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph using adjacency lists and priority queues. Demonstrates Java Collections, OOP principles, and algorithm optimization. Suitable for GPS routing, network optimization, and competitive programming.

Features:

Uses ArrayList and PriorityQueue for efficiency.

OOP-based modular design with an Edge class.

Handles positive weighted graphs.

Time complexity: O(E log V).

Usage:
Compile: javac DijkstraAlgorithm.java
Run: java DijkstraAlgorithm

Skills Demonstrated:
Java programming, collections framework, graph theory, problem-solving, optimization.
